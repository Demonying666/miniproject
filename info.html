            Hi! You can call me Jay, from Maasin City, Southern Leyte. I'm an information technology undergrad. I didn't finish college for some circumstantial reasons, but then again, my learning didn't stop there. Like what they say, "every day is a learning process," so I thrived from working for almost 10 years as technical support to a local computer and GSM service shop. That's where I honed my troubleshooting skills on both software and hardware. With that being said, I am an empirical person and am eager to learn.
            And my last known paid job was a lead miner for google360 campaign to a BPO company.
        </strong><br><br>
        <strong>
            I like having sensible conversations with people while having a bottle of beer in my hand and laughing hard, as well as playing online games with friends. What I don't like is discrimination of all sorts.
        </strong>
